Here are working ideas of a process that (a) is streamlined for efficient QI & research activities, while (b) provides oversight of how patient data is used responsibly.  This is an important, yet indepedent, discussion from the *architecture* of the CDW (clinical data warehouse).

Governance for *QI*
=================================================

Zsolt Nagykaldi, Director of Research at Family Medicine, describes their long-time QI governance process here.  We'd like to use it as a starting point for this process, while welcoming input from incoming CDW stakeholders.

1. A local department's QI project lead designs and submits a QI protocol to his/her department's QI Committee (if they don't have one, they will need to establish it, since this is the standard of operation today).

2. Local QI Committee approves the protocol and authorizes it for execution in their own organizational unit.

3. The QI Committee head writes a confirmatory document or e-mail to the project lead which is forwarded to the CDW governance group.

4. The CDW governance group approves and authorizes the data activity according to the protocol, exclusively for local (departmental) use.

5. Project lead acknowledges electronically in REDCap that the data will not be used for research and outcomes will not be published or disseminated beyond the department, unless IRB approval is obtained retrospectively and presented to the CDW governance group (e.g., as a secondary data analysis project)

Governance for *Research*
=================================================

The campus's 'REDCap Governance Committee' is working with the IRB to (a) promote responsible access and (b) streamline the application process when using REDCap.  The goal is that when the board reads that REDCap database is being used, several common issues will consume less reviewing time.  For example, they can trust that the server's administration will be addressed (eg, the authentication mechanism and the auditing log), and therefore dedicate more attentionto other issues such as who is given access to what data.

Similarly, we'd like to work with the IRB to create a streamlined regulatory process around the CDW.
