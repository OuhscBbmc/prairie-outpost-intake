# Spinup CDW Investigation Steps

# Definitions


# Steps

## Determine Project Tag

This name will be used in many places, including the (a) GitHub repository, (b) fileserver space, (c) CDW staging area, and (d) REDCap project.

The name should incorporate (a) PI's last name, (b) rough content area, (c) sequential index.  Examples include 'gillaspy-weedn-obesity-1', 'blucker-obesity-1', 'blucker-obesity-2', and 'obanion-adhd-1'.  Only lowercase letters, digits, and dashes are allowed; for the CDW staging area, we'll replace the dashes with underscores.

## GitHub repository


## Confirm IRB protocol

Ask for the IRB-approved document (not just their draft) of the protocol.  
1. Confirm they have permission to access PHI through the EMR/CDW.  (This is just an initial screen; we'll check the features more granularly later.)
1. Confirm the appropriate CDW team has permission.
1. save the document in the repository at `documentation/irb/`.


## Establish/confirm collaborator accounts

Send the following emails to collaborators:

1. OUHSC LDAP accounts (use [this skeleton](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/BbmcResources/blob/master/instructions/username.md))
1. REDCap instance (use [this skeleton](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/BbmcResources/blob/master/instructions/redcap.md))
1. GitHub repository (use [this skeleton](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/BbmcResources/blob/master/instructions/github.md)).
