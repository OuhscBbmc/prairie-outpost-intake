Brief Menu of EMR Messiness
==========================================

* Difference Patterns
    * across campuses
    * across clinics
    * across providers
    * across time
    * across time (even within the same clinic& provider)

* Different Outcomes
    * Units
    * Labs & Survey versions
        * different measures used to capture the same construct
        * same outcome labeled 2+ ways
        * 2+ outcomes labeled the same (so it's ambiguous)

* Mistakes/Omissions
    * Units      (eg, inches entered in the cm field)
    * Lab codes  (eg, 'zzz' entered in the CPT code field)

* Analysis
    * Interactions: Apparent deficits in clinic performance may be actually caused by differences in:
        * suboptimal measurements/Labs
        * protocols (eg, fasting was/wasn't enforced)
        * demographics
        * pre-existing dx/severity
    * MCAR, MAR, & NMAR

* Gestalt
    * Reassembling structure in a post-modern data structure.  Examples:  
        * did the blood test follow fasting?
        * was the child in DHS/CPS custody during the visit?
        * was an informal/undocumented skip pattern used? (So we need to consider the value of a previous field.)
        * two 'DTAP' admins are shown, but can we infer that it was the 2nd administration?
